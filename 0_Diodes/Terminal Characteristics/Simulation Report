Diode Characteristics

The static characteristics of the diode plots the diode current against the voltage across the diode.
The operation of the diode can be broken down into 3 regions:
  1) Forward Biased Region: When voltage across is greater than the knee voltage(~0.7V for Si diodes).
                      The device is said to be conducting and diode current Id is positive.
                      where, Id = $ Is(exp(Vd/nVt) - 1) $
  2) Reverse Biased Region:
