Diode Characteristics

The static characteristics of the diode plots the diode current against the voltage across the diode.
The operation of the diode can be broken down into 3 regions:
  1) Forward Biased Region: When the diode voltage($V_{d}$) is positve($V_{d}$ > 0).
                      The device is said to be conducting and diode current $I_{d}$ is positive.
                      where, Id = $I_{s}(e^{V_{d}/nV_{T}}-1)$.
  2) Reverse Biased Region: When $V_{d}$ is negative($V_{d}$ < 0).
                            $I_{d}$ ~ 0
  4) Breakdown Region: When $V_{d}$ is more negative than knee voltage($V_{zk}$).
                        Reverse current increases rapidly with reverse voltage.
