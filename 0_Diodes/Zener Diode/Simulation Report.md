# Zener Diode

Zener Diodes undergo Zener breakdown after a particular reverse voltage $V_{zk}$.
In this region the current mostly remains constant for a change in reverse voltage.
Thus, it can be used as a voltage regulator.

The DC analysis for the circuit below describes the static characteristic for the zener diode.
The zener diode used is 1N4742A which has a zener breakdown voltage of 11V.
